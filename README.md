# Boop

**Boop** is a lightweight proxy designed to expose services listening on loopback ip addresses. 

## Why?

    - To expose services on localhost
    - To expose services inside private networks
    - Because sometimes using ssh tunnels is just a pain
    - Because sometimes quick and dirty beats the clean way
